Some insights gained:
With a p-value of below 0.000, we can reject the null hypotheses and say there is relationship between radio marketing and sales beyond just pure chance.
With each 1M spent on Radio, it should lead to on average a [7.791 - 8.555] M increase in Sales with a 95% Confidence Interval.
